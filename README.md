Step 1: Data Preprocessing

Load Dataset:
Download the dataset from Kaggle.
Load the images and corresponding labels into your environment.

Explore Data:
Examine the distribution of different classes (Normal vs. Pneumonia).
Visualize sample images from each class.

Data Augmentation:
Apply transformations such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to augment the dataset.
Ensure the dataset is balanced across different classes.

Normalization and Splitting:
Normalize pixel values to a range suitable for neural network input.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.


Step 2: Autoencoder Implementation

Define Autoencoder Architecture:
Create an encoder network to compress input images to a lower-dimensional latent space.
Create a decoder network to reconstruct images from the latent space.

Train Autoencoder:
Train the model on the training set using mean squared error (MSE) loss.
Validate the model using the validation set.

Visualize Reconstruction:
Compare original and reconstructed images to evaluate the performance.
Visualize the latent space representations.


Step 3: Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

Define VAE Architecture:
Create an encoder that outputs both mean and variance for the latent space.
Implement a reparameterization trick to sample from the latent space.
Create a decoder to reconstruct images from the sampled latent vectors.

Train VAE:
Train the VAE using a combination of reconstruction loss and KL divergence.
Validate the model using the validation set.

Generate Samples and Anomaly Detection:
Generate new chest X-ray images by sampling from the latent space.
Use the VAE to identify anomalies by comparing reconstruction errors.


Step 4: Transformer Architecture

Define Transformer Model:
Implement a Vision Transformer (ViT) model suitable for image classification.
Define the input pipeline to convert images into patches and embed them.

Train Transformer Model:
Train the Transformer model on the training set using cross-entropy loss.
Validate the model using the validation set.

Evaluate Performance:
Evaluate the model on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
